Medium and large handling with delays test
Group 13
Tests the handling of medium to large files for each scheduler, and demonstrates how sjf can be tricked
into a sub-par order with delays.
Uses 3 files. 1 medium, 2 large. 
mlfb and rr should have the same output because they will not be tricked by the delay, while sjf will run linearly.
