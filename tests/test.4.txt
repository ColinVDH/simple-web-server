Large to small enqueue test
Group 13
Tests whether the mlfb and rr will correctly enqueue a small file while a large one is running.
Uses 4 files. 2 small, 1 medium, 1 large.
sjf should be in order, while mlfb and rr will finish a small one before the big file, because it will arrive 
before the big file is finished processing.
