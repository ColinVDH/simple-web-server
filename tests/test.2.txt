Simple varied linear test
Group 13
Tests whether each scheduler is doing its own job, and helps to show the difference.
Uses 3 files. 2 small, 1 large. 
It should output a different result for each of the schedulers,
because the delays prevent sjf from scheduling them, lets mlfb finish the small ones before the big one, and 
allows rr to do something in between.
