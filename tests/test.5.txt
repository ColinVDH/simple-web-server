Expanded large to small enqueue test
Group 13
Tests rr and mlfb similarly to test 4 to ensure that they correctly enqueue, but with more complexity.
Uses 4 files. 1 small, 1 medium, 2 large.
mlfb and rr should be the same, both finishing the small and medium files first, despite them arriving second and fourth, 
while sjf should ouput them in an order partly based on file size and partly on when they are received.
