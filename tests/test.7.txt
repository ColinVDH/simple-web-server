Many large file with single small test
Group 13
Tests how a combination of many large files with a small number of small files interact.
Uses 6 files. 1 small, 5 large.
mlfb and rr have the same results, finishing the single small file (despite it being the fifth to arrive) 
before any of the large ones. The largest file, the fourth to arrive, is the last to finish and otherwise they go in
order of arrival because they're the same size.
sjf gets the small one early enough to enqueue it before finishing many of the big files, but the difference in 
file sizes other than that are not enough to prevent it from running them in order.
