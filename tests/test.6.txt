Large to small enqueue vs linear test
Group 13
Tests the difference in overhead between the algorithms and shows how sjf can run in the order it receives in if there 
is too long a delay.
Uses 3 files. 1 small, 2 large.
mlfb and rr should output the same, because the two large files will never finish before the small file.
sjf will finish them in order, because there aren't enough to cause a lot of queuing.
